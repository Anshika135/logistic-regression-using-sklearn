# Logistic Regression Implementation Using Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression for
binary classification using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for
classification problems. It predicts the probability of a data point
belonging to a particular class.

This project covers the complete machine learning workflow including
data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading
2. Data preprocessing
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Prediction on test data
6. Model evaluation

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshika135/logistic-regression-using-sklearn.git
